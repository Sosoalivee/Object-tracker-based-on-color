# 🔴 Real-Time Red Object Tracker using OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV to detect and track red-colored objects in real-time using a webcam. It leverages color segmentation in the HSV color space and contour analysis to track the  object in the frame.

## 🎯 Features

- 📷 Real-time video processing using your webcam
- 🎨  color detection via HSV thresholding
- 🌫️ Noise reduction using Gaussian Blur, erosion, and dilation
- 🔍 Contour detection and localization of the object
- 🧠 Visual feedback: bounding circle and center dot over the object

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- imutils

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sosoalivee/red-object-tracker.git
   cd red-object-tracker
